# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release. This project is currently pre-1.0, so interfaces may change between minor releases.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository. Do not open a public issue containing credentials, authentication files, exploitable payloads, or private source code.

Include the affected version, operating system, Grok CLI version, reproduction steps, expected boundary, and observed behavior. Use synthetic secrets and a disposable repository whenever possible.

## Trust boundaries

This plugin does not make Grok local or offline. Grok Build may send prompts and file content to xAI according to the user's authentication method, plan, organization settings, and xAI policies. Review the current [Grok Build enterprise and data lifecycle documentation](https://docs.x.ai/build/enterprise) before using private or regulated source code.

Do not delegate:

- API keys, access tokens, cookies, passwords, or private keys;
- production `.env` files or credential stores;
- regulated data unless your organization has approved the relevant xAI configuration;
- unrelated personal files;
- repositories whose contents you are not authorized to share with the configured service.

## Sandbox facts

The bridge currently uses Grok's documented profiles:

- `read-only`: project writes are blocked; `~/.grok` and temporary paths remain writable;
- `workspace`: writes are allowed in the current working directory, `~/.grok`, and temporary paths.

On Linux, Grok documents child-network blocking for read-only and strict profiles. On macOS, that child-network restriction is not currently enforced. Network isolation is therefore not a portable guarantee of this plugin.

Some sensitive directories are protected by Grok independently of these profiles, but users should not rely on deny lists as a substitute for careful scope selection.

## Prompt injection

Repository files are untrusted model input. A malicious file can tell an agent to ignore instructions, expose data, or run commands. The worktree guard and sandbox reduce filesystem impact but do not prove that model output is correct or safe.

Codex should independently inspect relevant files, review every diff, and rerun tests. Agreement between Codex and Grok is not independent evidence if both consumed the same malicious repository content.

## Authentication handling

The bridge asks the official Grok CLI to use its advertised `cached_token` method. It never reads `~/.grok/auth.json`, prints tokens, or stores credentials. Grok child processes receive a minimal environment-variable allowlist instead of the bridge's complete environment. `XAI_API_KEY`, when present, is intentionally passed to the official CLI; additional variables require explicit opt-in through `GROK_PASSTHROUGH_ENV` and may be visible to Grok tools. The server also sanitizes common credential-shaped strings from retained errors and task prompts, but this is only a last-resort safeguard and not a complete secret scanner.

## Dependency and process model

The MCP server uses only Node.js standard-library modules. Markdown search does not require a Python package; optional structured-result validation requires `jsonschema`. Grok is launched with argument arrays rather than shell command interpolation. Search stdin is closed, output is bounded, deadlines are monotonic, and the owned process group receives TERM followed by KILL when cleanup requires escalation. The MCP bridge awaits bounded search cleanup during stdin close, SIGINT, and SIGTERM.

## Interactive handoff boundary

Interactive handoff is macOS-only and opens the official Grok TUI in a separate Terminal window. It is not an ACP-managed agent: Codex cannot observe its later prompts, approvals, filesystem activity, or completion state. Read-only handoffs use Grok's read-only sandbox. Writing handoffs start with `--worktree` and must originate at a Git repository root; the handoff prompt forbids commits, pushes, publication, and changes to other worktrees without fresh user authorization in that Terminal window.

The initial prompt is passed through a mode-0600 temporary file that the Terminal command removes before starting Grok. The prompt is sanitized but still leaves the machine for xAI under the user's Grok plan and policies. Do not use interactive handoff for secrets or unrelated personal data.

## Search boundary

Search mode deliberately avoids launching Grok from the user's current project or Git worktree. Each invocation uses a fresh temporary working directory while retained prompts, results, and private diagnostics stay under `~/.cache/grok-subagent/search-runs`. The bridge leaves native `HOME`, `GROK_HOME`, and CLI authentication discovery intact. It does not read, copy, or persist Grok authentication files.

The command enables only the public search and fetch tools, explicitly denies known local read, shell, edit, MCP, listing, grep, replacement, and terminal tools, disables memory and subagents, and sets compatibility environment switches that request suppression of imported Cursor and Claude integrations. These controls are not an operating-system sandbox and do not prove that all native global Grok configuration, hooks, or MCP initialization is absent.

Successful output must pass the version-2 completion contract. Failed and cancelled text is retained only as a private diagnostic artifact; legacy cache entries are shown as unverified. This reduces false-success risk but does not verify the truth of external content. Queries and retrieved public content still pass through xAI, and returned web, X, and Reddit content remains untrusted data.
